            After years of searching for a career where I could combine my creative and logical/mathematical sides, I have finally
            found an opportunity in full stack development. I recently pivoted from my thirteen year career in records and
            information management and as a new graduate from InceptionUâ€™s Full Stack Developer program, I am eager to build
            intuitive, functional, and beautiful applications that are user-friendly and can enhance people's daily lives.{" "}

            Drawing from my background and love of mathematics, I enjoy using my problem solving and analysis abilities to help
            deliver business solutions that increase efficiency and improve operations. I am extremely self-disciplined and
            utilize my attention to detail, and communication skills to consistently deliver outstanding results.
